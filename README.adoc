= Privacy Angels

This is an initial attempt at roughing out some Solidity to implement
the Privacy Angels concept [outlined on my blog]https://thomasbarker.com/16/05/privacy-angels .

== Future Work

* It's not very efficient to create a new angel for every transfer.
* There should be an Angel that checks a list of names. That list should be shareable and compact (bloom filter?).
* Unit test more than the happy path!
